# Overview

## Summary

From the beginning of 2020 a pandemic of unexpected magnitude hit the
whole world. The COVID-19 pandemic began with a high case fatality rate,
due to the inexperience against this disease. It was hard to fight back
from a medical point of view, no available treatments were proven to
work effectively. Some health and behavioraul policies helped to
diminish the case, however, the efforts were not enough and the pandemic
extended for over 2 years. COVID-19 affected different groups in a
particular way, whether because of their gender or ethnic group, this
disease was transmitted with more frequency or sadly the death rate was
higher amongst certain population.

**Keywords:** COVID-19, U.S.A. States, Biological Sex, Ethnic Group,
Case Fatality Rate.


# 1. Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also know
as COVID-19, is a virus that infects mammals and generates respiratory
diseases, like pneumonia. This type of virus has become a threat to the
human health decades ago. However, the COVID-19 virus posses a high
transmission rate, which led to a global pandemic (Ben Hu, et al.,
2021). In the United States, the COVID 19 pandemic began in January
2020, the transmission spiked in during the first trimester of 2020.
This virus variant was poorly characterized, which led to a poor
diagnostic and treatment, generating a high rate of mortality (Pei, S et
al., 2020). Project Tycho collected data from the pandemic in different
demographic variables, this data set will allow to understand the virus
death rate among different groups of persons.

# 2. Problem Definition

At the beginning of the pandemics, the COVID-19 virus was transmitted
uncontrollably among everyone in every part of the world. In this early
stage many people died due to the poor treatment options at that moment.
Did the virus had a stronger impact on certain group of people? Due to
different genetic characteristics we can assume a disease can have a
stronger effect on certain people. Thus, an analysis of the impact of
the virus can be performed to see if there is any relationship between
the biological sex of a person or the race with the death rate.

## 2.1 Problem

Is there a relationship between biological sex and death rate of
COVID-19? Is there a relationship between race and death rate of
COVID-19?

# 3. Objectives

## 3.1 General

The general objective of this research is to analyze data to correlate
the mortality of COVID-19 with a race or biological sex characteristic,
also, visualize the death rate by state, during the period of March 2020
until July 2021.

## 3.2 Specifics

-   Clean the data set provided by Tycho, maintaining the variables
    relevant for this study.
-   Generate summary statistics to understand the values of each
    variable in the dataset.
-   Generate graphs to represent the data of the variables.
-   Define if there is a relation between biological sex and death rate
    of COVID-19 through statistical test Chi-square.
-   Define if there is a relation between biological race and death rate
    of COVID-19 through statistical test Chi-square.

# 4. Methods and Analysis

## R Libraries

To begin, libraries are loaded into the script. Libraries contain the
functions needed to manipulate and analyze the data. For the present
report the following packages are loaded.

```{r Libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_light(base_size = 10)) #The theme of the graphs is preselected for all the document.
library(scales)
library(usmap)
library(incidence)
library(ggridges)
library(lubridate)
```

## Data Import

The data set was obtained from Tycho Project - University of Pittsburgh,
"Counts of COVID-19 reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 2019-2021". It
is in a .csv file, which can be imported into R and modified for the
purpose of the study

```{r Dataset}
US_Dataset <- read.csv("/Users/leonardo/Documents/LSI/2nd_Semester/Data Visualization/Exam_Valdes/US.840539006/US_840539006.csv")
```

## Data Shaping

The relevant variables from the dataset can be selected by subsetting
the original dataset. Also, the individual values that are missing or
that are not relevant for the study are removed by row filtering. Here
some values may be removed for specific graphs or statistical test. For
example, the variable **DiagnosisCertainty** posses the **"NA"**
category, which should be discarded for the present analysis, since we
are only analyzing data which have certain cases of COVID-19.

```{r Dataset_Clean, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
US_Dataset <- US_Dataset %>%
  select("Outcome", "Admin1Name", "PeriodStartDate", "PeriodEndDate", "BiologicalSex", "Race",  "DiagnosisCertainty") %>%
  filter(DiagnosisCertainty != "NA") 
```

## Data Cleaning

In this case, the following 7 variables are going to be used for the
statistical analysis and graphics representations: "Outcome",
"Admin1Name", "PeriodStartDate", "PeriodEndDate", "BiologicalSex",
"Race" and "DiagnosisCertainty"

We inspect the variables values, to understand which type of value it
is, e.g. categorical or quantitative.

```{r Data_cleaning, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}

Outcome_values <- unique(US_Dataset$Outcome)
print(Outcome_values)

Admin1Name_values <- unique(US_Dataset$Admin1Name)
print(Admin1Name_values)

BiologicalSex_values <- unique(US_Dataset$BiologicalSex)
print(BiologicalSex_values)

Race_values <- unique(US_Dataset$Race)
print(Race_values)

DiagnosisCertainty_values <- unique(US_Dataset$DiagnosisCertainty)
print(DiagnosisCertainty_values)

```

## Analysis

A exploratory graphical analysis is performed between different
variables. This will help to appreciate different tendencies of the
data. To complement the graphs, a statistical analysis is performed,
this will help to understand if there is any correlation between the
variables.

### 4.1 COVID CFR by Time

First, we build a graph to see the **case fatality rate** of COVID-19
through the period of 03.2020 until 07.2021.

```{r CFR Time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

#1. The count of number of cases and deaths is generated

Time_DeathR <- incidence(US_Dataset$PeriodEndDate, interval = "1 week", groups = US_Dataset$Outcome)


Time_Death_Dates <- as.data.frame(Time_DeathR[["dates"]])
Time_Death_Dates <- Time_Death_Dates  %>% 
  rename (dates = 'Time_DeathR[["dates"]]')

Time_Death_Counts <- as.data.frame(Time_DeathR[["counts"]])

#2. The case fatality ratio is calculated 

Time_Death_Ratio <- Time_Death_Counts %>%
  mutate(Total_cases = Dead + Unspecified) %>%
  mutate(death_ratio = (Dead / Total_cases)*1000)


#3. A column graph is created to represent the value of case fatality rate by a weekly period. 
D2C_ratio <- ggplot(data = Time_Death_Ratio, aes(x=Time_Death_Dates$dates, y=death_ratio))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = death_ratio), width=7) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1)+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 months",
               date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  geom_line(size = 3.5, color = "white", aes(color = death_ratio)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))+
  labs(y = "Case Fatality Rate x 1000 cases", 
       x = "Time in weeks" , 
       title= "Death to Case Ratio of COVID",
       subtitle = "Weekly deaths caused by COVID on the period of 03.2020 to 07.2021")+
  labs(fill = "CFR")+
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))
  
```

\

### 4.2 COVID CFR by State

The data set provides the number of cases by state. Thus it is possible
to calculate the CFR by state

```{r CFR_state, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#1. Counts of Deaths by State. 
State_clean <-  US_Dataset %>%
  group_by(Admin1Name) %>% 
  group_by(Outcome) 

State_counts  <- US_Dataset %>% 
  count(Admin1Name, Outcome) 

State_DeathRates <- read.csv("/Users/leonardo/Documents/LSI/2nd_Semester/Data Visualization/Exam_Valdes/Death_Rates.csv")

#2. A column graph is constructd to represent the values of CFR by states. The axes are inverted to have a better representation. 


StateDR <- ggplot(State_DeathRates)+
  geom_col(aes(y= reorder(state_name, rate), x=rate, fill = rate), width = 0.5)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 750, by = 50))+
  #scale_y_discrete(breaks = NULL)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1)+
  labs(x = "CFR by 1000", y = "State") +
  ggtitle("Case Fatality Rate by COVID in the U.S.A") +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=6.5, hjust=1),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")

```

##### COVID USA Maps

```{r CFR_Map, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#3. With the previous generated data we can assign the value to each U.S.A. state, to visualize in a color map the CFR by state
Statemap_CFR <- plot_usmap(data = State_DeathRates, values = c("CFR"="rate"), color = "white", regions = "states") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1, name = "CFR")+
  labs(title = "COVID-19 Case Fatality Rates in the U.S.A by states",
       subtitle = "Case Fatality Rate by 1000 of population. From 03.2020 to 07.2021") + 
  theme(panel.background=element_blank())

```

\

### 4.3 COVID CFR by Biological Sex

The data set also provides information about the Biological Sex of
confirmed cases. This allows to explore the CFR based on the Biological
Sex of the patient\

#### Graphic representation in a Bar Chart

Through a Stacked Bar chart we can compare the number of cases between
Male and Female groups.

```{r Bar_BS, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#1. Counts of Deaths by Biological Sex. 
#First, we filter the variable **"Biological Sex"** to maintain only the Female and Male values, leaving out unspecified data. 
#Then we obtain the counts of the variable Biological Sex and Outcome, with this data the bar graph is created.

BiologicalSex_clean  <- US_Dataset %>% 
  filter(BiologicalSex == "Male" | BiologicalSex == "Female")  %>% 
  arrange(PeriodStartDate, BiologicalSex)  %>% 
  group_by(BiologicalSex) %>% 
  mutate(numbering = row_number())
  
BiologicalSex_counts <-  BiologicalSex_clean %>% count(BiologicalSex, Outcome) 

#2. The package ggplot is used for graphing the data. Here a stacked bar plot is used to represent the counts of Dead and Survival by Biological Sex. 

BioSex_BarGrp <- ggplot (BiologicalSex_counts, aes(x=BiologicalSex, y = n, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_col(stat="identity", position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE))+
  labs(title = "Number of Cases by Biological Sex",x = "Biological Sex", y = "Total Number of cases", fill = "Outcome") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkblue","lightblue"), labels = c("Dead", "Survival")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = unit_format( unit = " ", digits = 3))


```

\

#### Total Number of COVID cases through Time

The data set gives the opportunity to analyze the cases by Biological
through time.

```{r Cases_BS, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
BiologicalSex_clean$PeriodStartDate <- ymd(BiologicalSex_clean$PeriodStartDate)


BioSex_Time <- ggplot(data = BiologicalSex_clean, aes(x = PeriodStartDate, y=numbering))+
  geom_line(aes(color = BiologicalSex), size = 1) +
  scale_x_date(limits = as.Date(c("2020-02-08", "2021-07-31")), 
               date_breaks = "2 months",
               date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))+
  ylim (250000, NA) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#de425b", "#005eb0")) +
  labs(y = "Total Number of cases", 
       x = "Date" , 
       title= "Number of COVID Cases by Gender ",
       subtitle = "Total Number of COVID cases in the period of 03.2020 to 07.2021")

```

\

#### Is Biological Sex associated with the chance of survival?

```{r Chisqe_BS, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
#1. Descriptive analysis to calculate the percentage and counts of deaths 


#2. Chi-Square analysis to prove relationship of the Biological Sex and Race.
#We use Chi-Square test for analyze the categorical variable Outcome based on the Biological Sex
BioSex_CountsChiSq <-  table(BiologicalSex_clean$BiologicalSex, BiologicalSex_clean$Outcome)

print(BioSex_CountsChiSq)

BioSexChiSqr <-chisq.test(BioSex_CountsChiSq, correct = FALSE)
print(BioSexChiSqr)
BioSexChiSqr$expected



```

\

### 4.4 COVID CFR by Race

This data set stores the number of cases based on Race. However the data
is reported only for the first trimester of the pandemic period.

##### Bar Graphic View

```{r Bar_Race, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
#1. Counts of confirmed cases and deaths by Race. 
Race_clean <-  US_Dataset %>%
  filter(Race == "American Indian or Alaska Native" | Race == "Asian" | Race == "Black or African American"| Race == "Multiracial"| Race == "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"| Race == "White" | Race == "Unspecified")   %>%
  arrange(PeriodStartDate)  %>% 
  group_by(Race) %>% 
  mutate(numbering = row_number())

Race_counts  <- Race_clean %>% 
  count(Race, Outcome) 

#2. The package ggplot is used for graphing the data. Here a colum plot is used to represent the counts of Dead and Survival by Race. 

Race_BarGrp <- ggplot (Race_counts, aes(x=Race, y = n, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_col(stat="identity", position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE))+
  labs(title = "Total Number of Cases of COVID-19 by Race", 
       subtitle = "Total number of cases of COVID-19 with its outcome",
       x = "Race", 
       y = "Percentage of Cases", 
       fill = "Outcome") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkblue","lightblue"), labels = c("Dead", "Survival"))+
  scale_x_discrete(limit = c("American Indian or Alaska Native", "Asian", "Black or African American", "Multiracial", "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander", "White", "Unspecified"),
                   labels=c("American Native", "Asian", "Black or African American", "Multiracial", "Pacific Islander", "White" , "Other") )+
  scale_y_continuous (labels = percent)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))

```

##### Is the Race associated with the chance of survival?

```{r ChiSqr_Race, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache = TRUE}

RaceChiSqr<-chisq.test(Race_clean$Outcome, Race_clean$Race, correct = FALSE)
print(RaceChiSqr)

Observed <- RaceChiSqr$observed
Expected <- RaceChiSqr$expected


```

# 5. Results

### 5.1 COVID CFR by Time

The **Case Fatality Rate (CFR)** is based on the number of deaths due to
a specific cause, in this case the number of deaths caused by COVID-19
divided by the total number of cases in a weekly period was used. The
results shows that at the beginning of the pandemic, January to February
2020, the CFR value was greater than 400 deaths per 1000 cases.
Afterward, this value diminishes for three months. Then the values rise
up, achieving its maximal CFR in mid August with approximately 550 CFR.
Then, for the rest of the time period the CFR is maintained between 300
and 400 CFR. Finally, during July, 2021 the CFR diminishes until to 300
CFR

```{r Figure_1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
D2C_ratio
```

*Figure 1. Death to case Ratio of COVID-19*

### 5.2 COVID CFR by State

In this column graph, we can observe a comparison of the CFR by states.
The top 5 states had a CFR value over 550 per 1000 cases. The bottom 5
states had values of under 75 CFR per 1000 cases. The average CFR value
is 500 deaths by 1000 cases

```{r Fig_2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
StateDR
```

*Figure 2. Case fatality rate by COVID-19 in the U.S.A by state*

The same values can be shown in a map, as shown in Figure 3. Here each
state is colored according to the CFR value, to have a refrenece of the
value the inferior label can be used.

```{r Fig_3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Statemap_CFR
```

*Figure 3. COVID-19 Case Fatality Rates in the U.S.A by states*

\

### 5.3 COVID CFR by Biological Sex

Through the count of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and death outcome we
can create a stacked bar graph as Figure 4. Here we can compare the
total number of cases between Male and Female groups. Also, it is
visible the outcome of the confirmed cases. The Female group had a lower
number of cases than the Male group, additionally, the survival and dead
ratio is similar. Men had a total of 303 515 cases, from which 229 353
died, giving a 75% of cases with a negative outcome. Women had a total
of 279 317 cases, from which 203 714 died, 73% of these cases had a
negative outcome.

```{r Fig_4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
BioSex_BarGrp
```

*Figure 4. Bar Graph of Total Number of Cases by Biological Sex*

In Figure 5, the total number of cases of COVID-19 can be seen as a line
graph. This one is useful to understand the cases from a quantitative
perspective. The Male group began with 275000 and ended with 305000
cases. For the Female group, at the beginning 250000 cases were
reported, and by the end of the period 280000 cases were confirmed.

```{r Fig_5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
BioSex_Time
```

*Figure 5. Line Graph of Total Number of COVID-19 Cases by Biological
Sex*

Additionally, to prove if here is any relationship between the
Biological Sex and the Case Fatality rate a Chi-Square test is used.
Here, the Null Hypothesis (Ho) is "There is no relationship between the
Case Fatality Rate and Biological Sex". After performing the statistic
test we obtain the results in Table 1.\

*Table 1. Summary of Chi-Square Test for Biological Sex*

| X-squared |  p-value  |    Ho    |
|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|
|  528.14   | \<2.2e-16 | Accpeted |

The p-value is close to 0, which indicates that the Ho is accepted.
Thus, There is no relationship between Biological Sex and CFR.

### 5.4 COVID CFR by Race

The data set reports the number of cases and number of deaths by race.
This data is represented in a column graph Figure 6. Here the scale is
shown as a percentage, for easily compare between the cases of the
different groups, due to the different number of size of each group. As
results, the groups "White" and "African American" present a greater
than 60% percentage of dead outcome, while the other groups stay below
50%.

```{r Fig_6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Race_BarGrp
```

*Figure 6. Total Number of Cases of COVID-19 by Race*\

To prove if there is any relationship between the Race and the Case
Fatality rate a Chi-Square test is used. Here, the Null Hypothesis (Ho)
is "There is no relationship between the Case Fatality Rate and Race".
After performing the statistic test we obtain the results in Table 2.

*Table 2. Summary of Chi-Square Test for Race*

| X-squared |  p-value  |    Ho    |
|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|
|  326657   | \<2.2e-16 | Accpeted |

The p-value is close to 0, which indicates that the Ho is accepted.
Thus, There is no relationship between Race and CFR.

# 6. Discussion

### 6.1 COVID CFR by Time

As we can see in Figure 1, there are two peaks, these can be interpreted
as the two first waves of the pandemic. The first peak ranges from
January to March, 2020, and the second from June to August, 2020.
According to Coccia(2021) this may be related to the confinement
policies. The unknown situation for the whole world made decision making
complicated, some policies were not strict enough which allowed a
stronger second wave as seen in the graph. Additionally, the little
connaissance about a correct treatment led to an increased number of
deaths. Many incorrect treatments were supplied which increased the
mortality risk among different vulnerable groups (Iftimie S., et al.,
2021)

### 6.2 COVID CFR by State

As you can see in Figure 2, Pennsylvania has a CFR of less than 15 by
1000 cases. This low value can be attributed to the confinement strategy
managed in this state. The policies stated a permanent lock down and a
progressive return to normal activities in the state. Each county was
followed specifically (Husch Blackwell LLP, 2021). This rigorous
policies may have been the cause of a low CFR. On the other hand, the
state of Louisiana implemented a more flexible contingency program.
People was able to leave their house to do run errands, even going to
restaurants to pick-up food (Office of the Governor, 2020). This
flexibility on their program may be responsible for the high number of
CFR cases.

### 6.3 COVID CFR by Biological Sex

The Figure 4, depicts that Male group had a higher number of cases than
the female group. However, the ratio death over survival is similar. One
of the causes could be the contact each group have. Even though women
have higher contact risk, men are the most infected by COVID-19, also
have a higher mortality rate (Doerre & Doblhammer, 2022).

The increment of cases for men and women is similar, as appreciated in
Figure 5. However it keeps being higher for men.

To prove if COVID-19 case fatality rate is associated by gender a
Chi-Square test is used in the data. The results observed in Table 1
suggests that there is no relationship. Thus, the lower value of case
count in women may be attributed to some other characteristic, for
example, the lifestyle of women, and even some genetic factors which
differs between men and women (Bwire, 2020).

### 6.4 COVID CFR by Race

During the COVID-19 pandemic many conclusions were obtained about how
and who affects this disease. The race trait was investigated, Figure 6,
shows a higher percentage of deaths for "Black or African American" and
"White" groups. This difference can be due to different factors that
affect each group, from its biology part to ther sociocultural
environment.

Through a Chi-Square test we can observe that there is no significant
relationship between race and CFR. However, Clay et al., (2021) states
that there are many aspects that puts "Black or African American" group
at higher risk, like accessibility to medicines, transport and social
health insurance. Thus, the percentage of cases and of deaths in this
group is higher than others.

# 7. Conclusions

To summarise, the COVID-19 pandemic began with high case fatality rate
value of 550 deaths per 1000 cases. Which could be attributed to the
unexpected development of the disease. The second wave of 2020, which
also presents a high CFR value could be due to the contingency policies.

The effect of different policies between the states played a main role
into the CFR value. Strict policies reduced the CFR while more flexible
increased the number. However, there was no protocol to follow at the
time.

It is interesting to peruse how a disease like COVID-19 affects
differently to persons depending on different factors. First, the
Biological Sex of a person can influence on the infection and CFR value,
probably not by inherent properties of the gender, but the behaviour of
it and the role it plays on the society. Similarly, this disease
affected in a different manner to different ethnic groups. Even though
there may be slight biological differences, the social characteristic
under which each group lives affects them differently.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic was hard to face due to the
inexperience of the humankind to deal with this event. Here, this
disease affected differently to different groups under different axes,
but this affection is more related to their social circunstances than
their biological factor.
