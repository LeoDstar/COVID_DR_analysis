Analysis of death cases by COVID in USA. 
From the beginning of 2020 a pandemic of unexpected magnitude hit the
whole world. The COVID-19 pandemic began with a high case fatality rate,
due to the inexperience against this disease. It was hard to fight back
from a medical point of view, no available treatments were proven to
work effectively. Some health and behavioraul policies helped to
diminish the case, however, the efforts were not enough and the pandemic
extended for over 2 years. COVID-19 affected different groups in a
particular way, whether because of their gender or ethnic group, this
disease was transmitted with more frequency or sadly the death rate was
higher amongst certain population.
